                           <b> Hi there,</b> I am a recent graduate from WorldQuant University (Data science boot camp) and I have completed my undergraduate at Kirinyaga University in Computer Science. Since graduating from WorldQuant, I decided to dig deeper into Machine learning and I have immense knowledge that I now consider myself a unicorn Data scientist
                        </p>

                      <a href="https://visualization-kenya-voters.streamlit.app/"><h2>1. Kenya voters visualization</h2></a>
                        
                        <p>This project aimed to test my data analysis and visualization skills. After downloading the data from the <a href="https://www.iebc.or.ke/">IEBC website</a> which was in pdf form. I wrote a Python script to convert the data to a  Comma Separated Value (CSV) file. Tapping the power of the pandas library I was able to clean the data while still maintaining the key columns values.
                            Now data is clean for the next step which was visualization. My favorite visualization library is Plotly Express. I wrote a Python script to group the data into counties (u.s equivalents of states ) and I was to plot the distribution of voters in each constituency and location using the visualization of barplot,<a href="https://www.edrawmind.com/article/sunburst-chart-template.html">Sunburst Diagram</a> , and pie chart. To ice the cake I used geopandas and geojson co-ordinates to plot the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">Choropleth map</a> for voters.
                        </p>
                   <p>These are the libraries i used: <br> Python, pandas,Plotly ,geopandas and Streamlit</p>
                    
                              <h2>2. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/samymigwi/sentiment-analysis-of-british-airline"> British Airways Data Science Job Simulation</a></h2>
                              <p>This project was a simulation of how data science skills are used in British Airways. This was an NLP project. The project aimed to do sentiment analysis for British airline reviews and present the findings to senior data scientist. I started the project by web scrapping the <a href="https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways">Skytrax website</a> for reviews of British airlines where I used the Beautiful Soup library. After obtaining the data I used the Spacy library for sentiment analysis and also the hugging face model for sentiment analysis. I then used the Plotly library to visualize the distribution of sentiment scores. Finally, I made a word cloud visual for the most words used in over 1000 British Airways reviews.
                              </p>
                              <p>These are the libraries i used: <br> Python, pandas,Plotly,Spacy,nltk,Beautiful Soup</p>

                              <p>PowerCo a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME, and residential customers has partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers. The first task was writing an email to PowerCo to request data that I would need for the project and also in which format should the data be. After getting the data I did an exploratory data analysis to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset. Then I 
verified the hypothesis of price sensitivity being to some extent correlated with churn and sent my findings. Using sklearn I build a predictive model using the features in data to predict if a customer is going to churn or not. After building the model I interpreted the model by deriving which features are the main contributors to customer churning. </p>

<P>I completed eight projects. Each project consists of four self-paced lessons, followed by an assignment that is programmatically graded.
   <ul> <br><b>HOUSING IN MEXICO:</b> <br>
    I use a dataset of 21,000 properties to determine if real estate prices are influenced more by property size or location. I import and clean data from a CSV file, built data visualizations, and examine the relationship between two variables using correlation.
    </li></ul>
    <ul><br><b>APARTMENT SALES IN BUENOS AIRES:</b> <br>
        I  build a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Argentina. I created a data pipeline to impute missing values and encode categorical features, and I improve model performance by reducing overfitting.
      </ul>
      <ul> <br><b>AIR QUALITY IN NAIROBI:  </b><br>
        I  build an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Kenya. I extract data from a MongoDB database using pymongo, and improve model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
        </ul>
    <ul><br> <b>EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE IN NEPAL: </b><br>
        I  built logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings. I extract data from a SQLite database, and reveal the biases in data that can lead to discrimination.
       </ul>
    <ul><br><b>BANKRUPTCY IN POLAND:</b> I  built random forest and gradient boosting models to predict whether a company will go bankrupt. I navigate the Linux command line, address imbalanced data through resampling, and consider the impact of performance metrics precision and recall.
    </ul>
     <ul><br><b>CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION IN THE US:</b> I  build a k-means model to cluster US consumers into groups. I used principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization, and I created an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.
    </ul>
    <ul> <br><b>A/B TESTING AT WORLDQUANT UNIVERSITY: </b>I conducted a chi-square test to determine if sending an email can increase program enrollment at WQU. I built custom Python classes to implement an ETL process, and I created an interactive data application following a three-tiered design pattern.
   </ul>
    <ul><br><b>VOLATILITY FORECASTING IN INDIA: </b>I  created a GARCH time series model to predict asset volatility. I acquired stock data through an API, clean and store it in a SQLite database, and built own API to serve model predictions.</P>
    </ul>
